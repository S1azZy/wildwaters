# Wild Waters Authz Security Flow

## When to use

Use when a task touches account identity, sessions, cookies, password reset, admin surfaces, Pundit policies, ownership checks, uploads/media, private/public visibility, exact user location, logs, credentials, or sensitive headers.

This skill narrows security context. It does not replace `docs/QUALITY_SECURITY.md`.

## Read

- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` permission matrix and verification matrix.
- `docs/QUALITY_SECURITY.md` security baseline and the relevant risk matrix row.
- `docs/CONTEXT_MAP.md` row for auth/session/password reset, admin/authorization, or the active feature area.
- `config/routes.rb` for request/controller flows.
- The relevant controller, policy, interactor/model, and matching request/policy/interactor specs.

## Do not read by default

- Unrelated policies or all request specs.
- Product/domain foundations unless product visibility or public/private behavior is ambiguous.
- ADRs unless the task explicitly touches an ADR-owned subsystem.
- Logs, credentials, env files, tokens, or signed blob URLs.

## Procedure

1. Classify risk: auth, password reset, session/cookie, authorization, admin, upload/media, privacy, public catalog/map data, imports/provenance, dependency, or logging/config.
2. Mark approval required when changing authentication, authorization, session, cookie, upload, or secret handling unless the user explicitly requested that change.
3. Define required proof before editing: owner/non-owner/guest/admin cases, token replay cases, visibility boundary, or no-secret logging check.
4. For behavior changes, write the failing request/policy/interactor spec first.
5. Keep authorization explicit and centralized through policies; do not trust client-provided ownership or roles.
6. Keep user-facing responses generic where enumeration risk exists.
7. Run the narrow specs, then `make security` when the risk matrix requires it.
8. Record any skipped or unrelated failing security gate exactly.

## Outputs

## Token economy

- Open only the risk matrix row and files named by the relevant context-map row.
- Use `rg "authorize|policy|Current.user|signed_id|password_reset|session"` to find the narrow boundary.
- Summarize large request specs by scenario names before reading bodies.
- Do not copy secrets or token-like strings into chat.
