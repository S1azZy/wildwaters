# Wild Waters Workspace State

## Purpose

Create a cheap, factual workspace snapshot so the agent does not repeat the
same git, PR, diff, and verification discovery throughout a task.

Use this skill as a state reader, not as an implementation workflow. It does
not replace `wildwaters-sdd-intake-gate`.

## Read Snapshot

Prefer this order and stop as soon as the task is oriented:

1. `git status -sb --untracked-files=all`
2. `git branch --show-current`
3. `git log -1 --oneline`
4. `git diff --stat` and `git diff --name-status` only when unstaged changes
   exist.
5. `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --cached --name-status` only when
   staged changes exist.
6. `gh pr view --json number,title,url,isDraft,headRefName,baseRefName` only
   when a PR matters and the branch appears pushed or tracking a remote.

Do not run broad history commands, full diffs, or GitHub checks unless the user
asked for them or the cheap snapshot leaves an ambiguity that affects the next
action.

## Output

Keep the snapshot compact:

```text
Branch:
Upstream:
Last commit:
PR:
Working tree:
Staged:
Unstaged:
Untracked:
Known verification:
Reusable evidence:
Needs fresh check:
Next safe action:
```

## Reuse Rules

- Reuse a verification result when it was run on the same branch after the
  touched files changed.
- Re-run a check when the command failed, the relevant files changed after the
  check, dependencies changed, the branch rebased, or the result came from a
  different checkout.
- Report known blockers exactly; do not hide them behind a new status query.
- Do not push, stage, commit, or edit files from this skill. Hand back to the
  active workflow after the snapshot.

## Gotchas

- `git diff --stat` omits untracked files. Pair it with `git status -sb
  --untracked-files=all` when new files matter.
- Staged renames plus unstaged edits can look like duplicate changes. Compare
  cached and working-tree name-status before staging again.
- Local branch state is not enough for stacked or already-open PRs. Check the
  PR metadata when publishing or rewriting an existing branch.
