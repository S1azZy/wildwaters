Sync delta specs from a change to main specs.

**Wild Waters CLI rule:** run OpenSpec through the repository wrapper:
`bin/openspec ...`. Do not use a bare `openspec` command in this checkout.

This is an **agent-driven** operation - you will read delta specs and directly edit main specs to apply the changes. This allows intelligent merging (e.g., adding a scenario without copying the entire requirement).

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `bin/openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show changes that have delta specs (under `specs/` directory).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Resolve change context**

   Run:
   ```bash
   bin/openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   If status reports `actionContext.mode: "workspace-planning"`, explain that workspace spec sync is not supported in this slice and STOP. Do not fall back to repo-local paths or edit linked repos.

3. **Find delta specs**

   Use `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from the status JSON as the list of delta spec files.

   Each delta spec file contains sections like:
   - `## ADDED Requirements` - New requirements to add
   - `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changes to existing requirements
   - `## REMOVED Requirements` - Requirements to remove
   - `## RENAMED Requirements` - Requirements to rename (FROM:/TO: format)

   If no delta specs found, inform user and stop.

4. **For each delta spec, apply changes to main specs**

   For each repo-local capability delta spec path returned by the CLI:

   a. **Read the delta spec** to understand the intended changes

   b. **Read the main spec** at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (may not exist yet)

   c. **Apply changes intelligently**:

      Before editing, write a compact per-requirement merge plan:
      - capability
      - delta section (`ADDED`, `MODIFIED`, `REMOVED`, or `RENAMED`)
      - requirement name before
      - requirement name after
      - exact scenarios to add, modify, preserve, remove, or rename
      - expected main-spec result

      **ADDED Requirements:**
      - If requirement doesn't exist in main spec → add it
      - If requirement already exists → update it to match (treat as implicit MODIFIED)

      **MODIFIED Requirements:**
      - Find the requirement in main spec
      - Apply the changes - this can be:
        - Adding new scenarios (don't need to copy existing ones)
        - Modifying existing scenarios
        - Changing the requirement description
      - Preserve scenarios/content not mentioned in the delta

      **REMOVED Requirements:**
      - Remove the entire requirement block from main spec

      **RENAMED Requirements:**
      - Find the FROM requirement, rename to TO

   d. **Create new main spec** if capability doesn't exist yet:
      - Create `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
      - Add Purpose section (can be brief, mark as TBD)
      - Add Requirements section with the ADDED requirements

   e. **Verify idempotency for this capability**
      - Re-read the updated main spec.
      - Re-apply the same delta mentally against the updated file.
      - If the second pass would add, remove, or rename anything again, fix the
        merge before moving on.
      - Record `Idempotency: no second-pass changes` in the summary.

5. **Show summary**

   After applying all changes, summarize:
   - Which capabilities were updated
   - What changed for each requirement:
     - before requirement/scenario state
     - after requirement/scenario state
     - preserved scenarios/content
     - idempotency result

**Delta Spec Format Reference**

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL do something new.

#### Scenario: Basic case
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Feature
#### Scenario: New scenario to add
- **WHEN** user does A
- **THEN** system does B

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Deprecated Feature

## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: `### Requirement: Old Name`
- TO: `### Requirement: New Name`
```

**Key Principle: Intelligent Merging**

Unlike programmatic merging, you can apply **partial updates**:
- To add a scenario, just include that scenario under MODIFIED - don't copy existing scenarios
- The delta represents *intent*, not a wholesale replacement
- The merge must be explainable requirement-by-requirement; do not rely on a
  vague "sensible merge" without before/after evidence.

**Output On Success**

```
## Specs Synced: <change-name>

Updated main specs:

**<capability-1>**:
- Added requirement: "New Feature"
  - Before: absent
  - After: requirement with 1 scenario
  - Idempotency: no second-pass changes
- Modified requirement: "Existing Feature"
  - Before: 2 scenarios
  - After: 3 scenarios (added "New scenario"; preserved existing scenarios)
  - Idempotency: no second-pass changes

**<capability-2>**:
- Created new spec file
- Added requirement: "Another Feature"

Main specs are now updated. The change remains active - archive when implementation is complete.
```

**Guardrails**
- Read both delta and main specs before making changes
- Preserve existing content not mentioned in delta
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification
- Show the per-requirement before/after plan before or while changing specs
- The operation must be idempotent: running the same sync twice should produce
  no additional spec changes
