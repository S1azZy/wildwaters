description: Use before starting any Wild Waters repository task, before tests, implementation edits, generated artifacts, or task-specific app commands. Classifies SDD Level 0-3, records OpenSpec/ADR need, chooses context from docs/CONTEXT_MAP.md, applies the Make/container command contract, identifies approvals, and states the verification path.

# Wild Waters SDD Intake Gate

## Purpose

Run the project intake gate before doing repository work in Wild Waters. This
skill does not implement the task and does not replace project docs; it turns
the request into a short, auditable task packet and routes to the correct
workflow.

## Load The Control Plane

If not already loaded in this turn:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the SDD gate, task router, task levels, command contract, permission
   matrix, verification matrix, and final response contract in
   `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
3. Read only the relevant rows from `docs/CONTEXT_MAP.md` after classifying the
   task area.

Do not scan the whole repository unless the user asked for repository-wide work
or classification cannot be resolved from the owning docs and neighboring files.

## Classify Before Action

Before tests, implementation edits, generated artifacts, or task-specific app
commands, classify the request:

| Level | Use for | OpenSpec/ADR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0: Non-functional maintenance | Documentation, process rules, comments, formatting, skill text, or other edits that do not change runtime behavior, product acceptance criteria, schema, dependencies, or security posture | none |
| 1: Direct | Copy, visual polish, obvious narrow bugs, small contract-preserving refactors, evidence-backed baseline corrections | none |
| 2: Specified feature | Meaningful behavior, interacting mechanisms, uncertain requirements, persistent acceptance criteria | OpenSpec change |
| 3: Architectural feature | Level 2 plus a durable, cross-cutting, difficult-to-reverse decision | OpenSpec change plus ADR for the confirmed architecture decision |

If the user explicitly opts out of SDD or OpenSpec, record that as a scoped
exception for this task only. Do not treat it as a new default.

## Emit The Task Packet

For non-trivial work, state this packet before mutation. Keep it factual and
compact.

```text
Task:
Task type:
SDD level: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
OpenSpec change: none | change-name | needed
ADR: none | required | path
Behavior change: yes/no
Risk class: docs_only | low | medium | high
Docs loaded:
Context map entries used:
Neighboring files to inspect:
Red test required: yes/no
Approval required: yes/no
Planned verification:
Done condition:
```

Use the packet as the handoff shape after compaction, approval waits, or long
tool runs.

## Route The Work

- **Level 0:** edit the owning source of truth, avoid duplicating rules, update
  `CHANGES.md` when the process, harness, user-facing docs, dependencies, or
  behavior records change, then run `git diff --check`.
- **Level 1:** inspect neighboring files and existing specs, keep the change
  narrow, use a red test when runtime behavior changes, and run the matching
  verification from `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **Level 2:** invoke `$wildwaters-spec-driven-change` for explore, confirmed
  proposal, apply, verify, and archive. Do not create OpenSpec artifacts before
  the user confirms the explored direction.
- **Level 3:** follow Level 2 and create or update an ADR only for the confirmed
  durable architecture decision. Keep feature behavior and task lists in
  OpenSpec.

When implementation learning changes approved intent, pause. Update the
affected OpenSpec artifact or ADR and obtain approval before divergent coding
continues.

## Choose Commands Up Front

Select the command environment before running task-specific commands:

- Use the host shell for `rg`, `sed`, git inspection, file reads, `apply_patch`,
  Docker orchestration, and project-local OpenSpec wrappers.
- Use Make/container targets for Rails, Ruby, Bundler, RSpec, RuboCop, security
  checks, frontend install/build/test/audit, migrations, imports, and dependency
  freshness.
- Use `bin/openspec ...` or documented Make OpenSpec targets inside this
  checkout; do not use a bare `openspec` command.
- Do not try raw host `bundle`, `rails`, `rspec`, `rubocop`, `brakeman`,
  `bundler-audit`, `npm`, `npx`, `vite`, or `tsc` for app work.

If a command requires approval under the permission matrix, stop and ask before
running it.

## Approval Stops

Ask before:

- adding a gem, package, external service, or runtime dependency;
- introducing a new architecture pattern or broad future abstraction;
- changing authentication, authorization, session, cookie, upload, secret, or
  user-owned-resource behavior;
- creating triggers, stored procedures, or non-obvious database constraints;
- running destructive cleanup;
- pushing, publishing, or opening a PR unless the user explicitly requested it.

Hard stops from `AGENTS.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` still apply even when the
user asks for speed.

## Finish

Before claiming completion:

1. Run the planned verification or report the exact blocker.
2. Check whether `CHANGES.md` is required.
3. Summarize files changed, verification commands and results, remaining
   failures or skipped checks, and branch/PR details when applicable.

Do not present heuristic inspection as mechanical proof. Tests, strict
OpenSpec validation, and project gates are the readiness proof.
