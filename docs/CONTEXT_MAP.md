# Context Map

This document owns task-specific context loading for Codex. Its job is to help
the agent read the smallest useful file set before acting.

Use it after classifying the task with `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`. Do not use it as a
substitute for inspecting neighboring files; local examples still win.

## Loading Rules

- Start from the relevant row below, not from a repository-wide scan.
- Read listed source-of-truth files first, then the directly relevant app/spec
  files, then neighboring examples.
- Prefer `rg` and targeted file reads over broad directory dumps.
- Read generated artifacts only when the task depends on their generated
  output.
- For Level 2 or 3 work, inspect related active changes before creating a new
  change and read current capability specs before changing existing behavior.
- Treat ADRs as implemented architecture decisions, not feature specifications.
- Use `docs/TODO.md` only when selecting or scoping unimplemented work.
- If a source still conflicts with established code and RSpec, treat the
  implementation as evidence and repair the owning document.
- If the mapped context is insufficient, expand one directory or pattern at a
  time and record what was added in the task packet.

## Updating This Map

Update `docs/CONTEXT_MAP.md` when:

- a new top-level app area, namespace, or repeated workflow is added;
- files are moved, renamed, or made canonical;
- a new ADR changes where agents should look first;
- a repeated Codex failure came from missing or excessive context;
- task routing in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` changes;
- README or source ownership changes affect human/agent entrypoints.

Update style:

- Prefer changing one row over adding broad instructions.
- Remove stale paths in the same edit that introduces new ones.
- Keep this file as an index, not a tutorial.
- Validate with `git diff --check` for docs-only updates.
